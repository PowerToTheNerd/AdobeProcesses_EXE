# AdobeProcesses_EXE
Zero manual effort needed â€“ this tool appends a single letter to the '.exe' extension of each file as "Guide 8" instructions explain.
Download the necessary files from the "DIST" directory, where you'll locate the essential files.
By executing the "Rename.exe" file, you'll perform the actions detailed in "Guide #8 - Blocking unnecessary Adobe Background processes(PS/DC)." 
On the other hand, the "Undo.exe" file serves to undo the modifications made to the files. 
Remember, for successful execution, run both files with administrator privileges.
