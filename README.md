# AdobeProcesses_EXE
Zero manual effort needed â€“ this tool appends a single letter to the '.exe' extension of each file as "Guide 8" instructions explain.
Inside the "DIST" directory, you'll find the essential .exe files required for running this program. 
By executing the "Rename.exe" file, you'll perform the actions detailed in "Guide #8 - Blocking unnecessary Adobe Background processes(PS/DC)." 
On the other hand, the "Undo.exe" file serves to undo the modifications made to the files. 
Remember, for successful execution, run both files with administrator privileges.
